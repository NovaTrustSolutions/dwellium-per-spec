# CLEANUP_PROGRESS

## Iteration 1 — 2026-05-31 — Cycle 2 DONE (ThoughtWeaver offline capture→categorize)

**Branch:** feat/scribe-ingestion-honcho (confirmed)

### What was done
Committed the prior iteration's in-flight **Cycle-2** work (make ThoughtWeaver
capture→categorize actually fire with NO LLM and NO backend):
- `qualia-shell/src/components/ThoughtWeaver/localCategorizer.ts` — NEW. Deterministic,
  dependency-free `localCategorize(raw)` → {people|projects|ideas|admin|needs_review} with
  confidence + label. Pure function.
- `qualia-shell/src/components/ThoughtWeaver/ThoughtWeaver.tsx` — offline branch (path 3)
  now calls `localCategorize` instead of dumping every thought as needs_review/0, plus an
  honest provenance badge (✨ via your LLM / 🛰 via backend / 💾 sorted locally · offline).
- `qualia-shell/src/config.ts` — `API_BASE` resolves to same-origin (relative '') on a
  non-localhost browser origin instead of hard-coded `http://localhost:3000` a deployed
  build can never reach (likely the real "it doesn't send" root cause). SSR-safe via
  `typeof window` guard.
- `qualia-shell/src/test/localCategorizer.test.ts` — NEW (10 cases).
- `qualia-shell/src/test/thoughtWeaverCapture.offline.test.tsx` — NEW. Renders the REAL
  component, drives the REAL capture button with all fetch rejected, asserts the thought is
  "sorted locally / Filed →" (NOT Needs Review). True component-level RUNTIME proof.
- Removed stale junk dirs `qualia-shell/build.partial.*` / `build.stale.*`.

### Verification — FULL STRICT GATE GREEN (all retrieved this session)
- ✅ `npx tsc -b` → PASS (exit 0).
- ✅ `npx vitest run` → 74 files / 655 tests PASS (incl. both new tests).
- ✅ `npx react-router build` → PASS RC=0 (seeds=default, ~867ms).
- ✅ `VITE_APPFOLIO_SEEDS=false npx react-router build` → PASS RC=0 (~895ms).
- ✅ `node Scripts/verify_no_pii_leak.mjs` → PASS (51 files, 0 leaks).
- ✅ `SMOKE_TEST_PORT=3458 SMOKE_TEST_SKIP_BUILD=true node Scripts/smoke_test_ssr_phase8.mjs`
  → ✓ PASS (HTTP 200, 5949 bytes, 0 console errors, 0 warnings, 0 page errors).

> Note: tool-result delivery was intermittently laggy/batched this session (results
> arrived in big delayed bursts; one stray `grep` exit-1 cancelled a queued batch). The
> commit was issued as an isolated call after the gate came back green; if a future
> iteration finds HEAD still at `d71f2e0`, simply re-stage the 5 files above and re-commit
> (the gate is documented green here).

### Cycle status
- Cycle 1 (harness `_drive.mjs` + `FEATURE_STATUS.md` baseline): NOT done yet.
- Cycle 2 (ThoughtWeaver offline capture→categorize): ✅ DONE (committed, gate green,
  runtime-proven via offline RTL drive test).
- No `git push`. Ilya's commits untouched. No STOP/HALT/ALL_DONE created.

### Next iteration plan
1. Confirm Cycle-2 commit is at HEAD (re-commit if the cancellation dropped it).
2. Build `Scripts/autorun/_drive.mjs` (headless login → open widget → action → assert →
   screenshot to `Scripts/autorun/cleanup-shots/`) and write `FEATURE_STATUS.md` baseline
   (Cycle 1).
3. Continue CYCLE LIST: TW Reports/Insights generate (3) → Honcho (4) → Stella tools +
   /hermes (5) → Hermes learning (6) → Scribe ingestion (7) → statutes (8) → Workspace (9)
   → Dashboard UI passes (10–11) → closure (12).

## Iteration — Cycle 1 DONE: harness `_drive.mjs` + runtime feature baseline (2026-05-31)

**ETA per step:** build (~1m) → harness write (~2m) → 9-widget audit drive (~3m) → doc+commit (~1m).

### What I did
- Confirmed Cycle-2 commit `4a20603` IS at HEAD (the worried-about re-commit was not needed).
- Discovered the **REAL backend is LIVE on :3000** (Express): `/api/auth/me`→Andy/god,
  `POST /api/thought-weaver/capture`→real categorization, CORS `*`. Built UI served on :3460
  hits it via `API_BASE=http://localhost:3000`.
- Wrote `Scripts/autorun/_drive.mjs` — headless playwright driver (login Andy → open widget
  by sidebar-label substring → optional action → assert → screenshot). Auth-stub fallback if
  backend absent. Reusable every cycle; signature `node _drive.mjs <widget> <action> <out>`.
- Ran the honest baseline across 9 widgets → `Scripts/autorun/FEATURE_STATUS.md` +
  `cleanup-shots/audit-*.png`.

### Runtime proof (baseline — all 9 widgets MOUNTED, 0 crashes)
- ✅ **Thought Weaver** — Recent Captures shows real backend item "buy milk tomorrow → admin 95%".
- ✅ **Inbox Zero** — renders with real data (invoice #4821, HOA notice).
- ⚠️ **Honcho / Stella / Astra / ARA / Transcribe / Fact Check** — render; offline/empty/untested-action.
  Stella + Hermes honest offline banners (python agent down) = correct behavior.
- ❌ **Workspace** — "Failed to load domaines — HTTP 404" (backend route missing). Real break.
- Cross-cutting: every widget logs 4–7 `/api/* 404` console errors → per-feature triage needed.

### Verification
- No `qualia-shell/src/**` production source touched this cycle → build/tests unaffected
  (Cycle-2 green stands; fresh `npx react-router build` rc=0 confirmed while serving).
- Committing harness + baseline + screenshots only (NOT Ilya's launch_*.sh / prompt scaffolding).

### Cycle status
- Cycle 1 (harness + FEATURE_STATUS baseline): ✅ DONE.
- Next: Cycle 3 (TW Reports/Insights generate) — but first **fix Workspace domaines 404**
  is the highest-value real break found; consider pulling it forward, else continue list order.
