# Phase 2 Task 2.8 — Sentiment Static Handlers + At-Risk Fixture + SentimentModule Rewire · Completion Report

**Task.** 2.8 — Sentiment: 3 new static handlers + new fixture + module rewire per plan v2.8 §8 L330. v1 L144's "20 at-risk rows" acceptance preserved by fixture construction (rows 0–19 of the new `sentiment_scores.json` carry `atRisk: true`); `entities.json` not touched per the L330 explicit guard. Sixth Phase-2 general-pool task landed post-B3.

**Branch.** `feat/phase-2-task-2.8-sentiment-static-handlers` off `main@d964a72`.

**Commits (pre-squash, atomic, all strict-gate-green).** 3 commits ahead of `main` (branch creation was step "A" of the A–F micro-plan, not a commit; B / C / D each landed independently green).
1. `962c452` — `feat(phase-2): Task 2.8 commit B — sentiment static handlers + fixture` — NEW `qualia-shell/public/data/sentiment_scores.json` (40 rows / 20 at-risk / deterministic from sorted `entities.json` tenantIds; zero real AppFolio PII, all comments templated/generic) + 3 handlers in `strataApi.static.ts` (`/sentiment/scores`, `/sentiment/history`, `/sentiment/by-entity`) inserted between `/forecast` (L558) and `/search/health` (L559). Vitest delta on commit: 0.
2. `0e103ec` — `feat(phase-2): Task 2.8 commit C — module rewire + types hoist + isStaticMode export` — types hoist into `packages/types/index.ts` (post-B3 additive append, 4th post-2.7 amendment after Tasks 2.2 / 2.10 / 2.4); `export const isStaticMode = USE_STATIC;` added to `strataApi.ts:36` immediately after the canonical 3-form-aware `USE_STATIC` derivation; `SentimentModule.tsx` full rewire (raw fetches → `strataGet`; POST guarded on imported `isStaticMode`; ErrorBoundary wrap; 4 Sentry breadcrumbs; `data-testid` anchors per (f) Option 1). Vitest delta on commit: 0.
3. `19eb965` — `test(phase-2): Task 2.8 commit D — sentiment.test.ts (1 placeholder → 8 it-blocks)` — replaces the Phase-0 placeholder stub with 8 contract tests modeled on `forecast.test.ts` (Task 2.4 precedent); covers all 3 handlers, GR-2 entities.json drift guard (322 + 0 non-active), GR-3 fixture FK integrity + uniquePropertyIds.size === 2 pin, aggregate + channel-type consistency, community-branch defensive shape. Vitest delta on commit: +7 (8 new − 1 placeholder).

**Merge SHA (post-squash).** `<TBD-on-merge>` — backfilled mechanically by the post-merge sweep per the Task 2.4 / 2.10 / 2.1 / 2.2 / 2.5 / 2.3 / 2.6 precedent.
**Closure date.** 2026-04-24.

## Summary

Task 2.8 ships the **Sentiment static handler tier** that `SentimentModule.tsx` has lacked since Phase 1 — the module hit `localhost:3000/api/sentiment/{trends,response}` directly, which silently failed in static-mode builds (Netlify deploy + sandboxed CI + Playwright runs all fell back to a "Could not connect to backend" experience). Three new GET handlers + a new fixture light up the read path in static mode; the POST write path is short-circuited cleanly via the new canonical `isStaticMode` export from `strataApi.ts`.

**Scope (DoR-PRE0 + PRE1 + (a)–(f) ack chain):** plan v2.8 §8 L330 governs (3 handlers + new fixture + module rewire); v1 L144's "20 at-risk rows" acceptance is preserved by fixture construction. v1 L144's "3,274 captured tenants" + "Past-status" was a Task-2.4-class drift from pre-capture estimation — PRE1 confirmed the real surface is **322 active tenants, 0 non-active** — documented as a Phase-3 AppFolio re-capture deferral in §7.

**Files touched (Appendix D impact):**
- NEW: `qualia-shell/public/data/sentiment_scores.json` (Appendix D adds a new row, Phase-2 owner = Task 2.8).
- AMEND: `qualia-shell/src/components/StrataDashboard/strataApi.static.ts` (3 GET handlers; +119 LOC; Appendix D row 3 `Task 2.* rebase onto each other` honored).
- AMEND: `qualia-shell/src/components/StrataDashboard/strataApi.ts` (1-line `export const isStaticMode = USE_STATIC;` + 8-line block comment naming the 3-form gotcha; first module-level static-mode helper in the codebase — `ProfilesModule.tsx:78` had only a code comment, not branching).
- AMEND: `qualia-shell/src/components/StrataDashboard/modules/SentimentModule.tsx` (full rewire: read paths, POST guard, ErrorBoundary, Sentry breadcrumbs, testids).
- AMEND: `packages/types/index.ts` (8 new `Sentiment*` types — post-B3 additive append; Appendix D row 1 text **UNCHANGED** per precedent across PRs #8–#16).
- REPLACE: `qualia-shell/src/test/appfolioParity/sentiment.test.ts` (1 placeholder → 8 it-blocks).
- NOT touched: `qualia-shell/public/data/entities.json` (plan v2.8 §8 L330 explicit guard); `properties.json` (Task 2.4 + 2.10 READ-ONLY retirement preserved); `workitems.json` (Task 2.1 → 2.6 sequential preserved); `strataApi.backend.ts` (GR-5).

**Vitest count.** 159 → **166** (delta net +7 = 8 new − 1 placeholder; matches the DoR prediction exactly).

**B3 chain status.** Closed at Task 2.7 merge `40875db`. Task 2.8 is the **fourth post-B3 additive append** to `packages/types/index.ts` after Tasks 2.2 / 2.10 / 2.4. **Not** a B3 reopen.

## §1 — Scope & DoR evidence

### DoR + ambiguity resolutions (all green)

(a) **Pure v2.8 scope.** v2.8 §8 L330 supersedes v1 L144 on scope (3 handlers + new fixture + module rewire); v1 L144 still anchors the acceptance test ("20 at-risk rows") and gate (GR-4). Fixture carries the 20 at-risk rows; entities.json untouched.

(b) **(b-sub1)** — `export const isStaticMode = USE_STATIC;` added to `strataApi.ts` rather than the inline `import.meta.env.VITE_USE_STATIC_API === 'true'` form. Decisive evidence: `USE_STATIC` accepts THREE forms (`true`, `'true'`, `'1'`) per `strataApi.ts:23-24`; an inline check would silently diverge from the router's routing decision when the flag is set as boolean `true` or `'1'`, sending POSTs to a backend that isn't there in static-mode builds. Hard bug, not style. (b-sub2) ruled out.

(c) **Post-B3 additive append framing.** B3 serial chain (2.3 → 2.5 → 2.7) closed at `40875db`. Task 2.8 is the **4th post-B3 additive amendment** after Tasks 2.2 (L621), 2.10 (L728), 2.4 (L807). Section-comment block shape mirrors Task 2.4 L807 verbatim. Appendix D row 1 text **UNCHANGED** (precedent across PRs #8–#16; verified pre-DoR).

(d) **d1 + d3 hybrid.** 20 at-risk rows of the 322 active tenants, deterministic from sorted tenantId; v1's "3,274" → Phase-3 AppFolio re-capture deferral ledger entry in §7.

(e) **entities.json non-mutation guard.** Both halves of the drift assertion land in test #6 — `tenants.length === 322` AND `tenants.filter(t => t.status !== 'active').length === 0`. Catches row-count drift AND any future status-field mutation.

(f) **Option 1 testid + data-atrisk.** `sentiment-tenant-row` on every `<tr>`; conditional `data-atrisk="true"` only when `t.atRisk` (no `data-atrisk="false"` ever rendered; selectors work on attribute presence). Per-tab testids `sentiment-tab-{all,atrisk,add}`. Stats cards `sentiment-stats-card` (×4). Detail panel `sentiment-detail-panel` + conditional `sentiment-detail-atrisk-badge`.

### PRE1 reality re-contact (recap)

- Tenants total: **322** (v1's "3,274" drift confirmed); statuses: `{ active: 322 }`; no Past status exists.
- `sentiment_scores.json` did not exist pre-Task-2.8 (now NEW).
- No pre-existing sentiment routes in `strataApi.static.ts`.
- `packages/types/index.ts` had zero `Sentiment*` types — only the `'sentiment'` literal in the `StrataModule` union (L880).
- ProfilesModule precedent grep: line 78 is a *code comment* mentioning `VITE_USE_STATIC_API`, no branching code. Task 2.8 establishes the first module-level `isStaticMode` consumption.

**Pre-existing-warnings note.** Chunk-size warnings (StrataDashboard 1,012 kB / TranscriptionHub 2,339 kB) and the `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.jsep.wasm` runtime-resolve warning are unchanged from the Task 2.6 baseline; the `StrataDashboard` chunk-hash drift `Cyc6wJ5v` is expected from Task 2.8's module rewire + new types landing in that chunk. **Module-count parity** between `VITE_APPFOLIO_SEEDS=true` and `=false` builds (3278 === 3278) — GR-7 satisfied (no flag-divergent module graph).

## §3 — CDP render proof

**Tool.** Headless Playwright chromium against `VITE_USE_STATIC_API=true VITE_APPFOLIO_SEEDS=true` dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`. Probe script: `qualia-shell/cdp_probe_task_2_8.cjs` (one-shot, repo-local, NOT committed — pattern mirrors Task 2.4 / 2.6 harness).

**Nav path.** `nav-root` → click `.login-start-overlay` → click "Andy" persona → fill gate passphrase (`Comet2878!`) + Enter → expand Property Management sidebar group → click Strata widget → click "Sentiment" nav button → SentimentModule renders.

**Probe DOM snapshot — All Tenants tab (default):**
```json
{
  "moduleRendered": true,
  "tenantRowCount": 40,
  "atRiskRowCount": 20,
  "statsCardCount": 4,
  "hasTabAll": true,
  "hasTabAtrisk": true,
  "hasTabAdd": true
}
```

**Probe DOM snapshot — At Risk tab (after click `[data-testid="sentiment-tab-atrisk"]`):**
```json
{
  "tenantRowCount": 20,
  "atRiskRowCount": 20
}
```

**Guard return value:**
```json
{
  "moduleRendered": true,
  "allTabRowCountIs40": true,
  "allTabAtRiskCountIs20": true,
  "statsCardCountIs4": true,
  "allThreeTabsPresent": true,
  "atriskTabRowCountIs20": true,
  "atriskTabAtRiskCountIs20": true,
  "zeroConsoleErrors": true,
  "zeroPageErrors": true,
  "allPass": true
}
```

**All 9 guard conditions PASSED.** Per the v1 L144 + (f) Option 1 acceptance:
1. SentimentModule renders (`[data-testid="sentiment-module"]` present). ✓
2. All Tenants tab default: 40 `sentiment-tenant-row` (full fixture rendered). ✓
3. All Tenants tab default: 20 of those 40 carry `data-atrisk="true"` (20 at-risk inside the 40-row set). ✓
4. 4 stats cards rendered (Total Tracked / At Risk / Improving / Avg Score). ✓
5. All three tabs present (`sentiment-tab-all` / `sentiment-tab-atrisk` / `sentiment-tab-add`). ✓
6. After clicking At Risk tab: exactly 20 rows (filter correctness). ✓ — **v1 L144 GR-4 acceptance proof on the live DOM.**
7. After clicking At Risk tab: all 20 of those rows carry `data-atrisk="true"` (filter has no false positives/negatives). ✓
8. Zero console errors (Sentry-DSN absence + favicon noise filtered as pre-existing per Task 2.4 / 2.6 precedent). ✓
9. Zero page errors. ✓

Artifacts:

## §4 — /security-review deep pass (Task 2.8 only)

### Sink grep (new code only)

Targeted grep across the Task 2.8 diff for known sink patterns (XSS, SQL, command injection, prototype pollution, ReDoS, SSRF, path traversal, prototype access, `eval`, `Function`, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, computed property reads from input):

- **strataApi.static.ts new handlers** — read-only over an in-memory cached array (`loadTable('sentiment_scores')`); strict `===` filter on `propertyId` / `tenantId` / `entityId`; no computed key access (`row[params.x]` — never used); no path/URL concatenation from user input; no template-string injection; defensive zero-aggregate / empty-shape returns on miss; never throws.
- **SentimentModule.tsx rewire** — `setSubmitMsg(...)` is React text node only (no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`); `Sentry.addBreadcrumb` is wrapped in try/catch (no DSN-absence throw); `data-testid` and `data-atrisk` attribute spreads use object-literal keys only (no input-derived keys).
- **strataApi.ts `isStaticMode` export** — exposes a `boolean` constant, no runtime computation; consumers cannot weaponize it.
- **packages/types/index.ts** — types only; no runtime side-effects.
- **sentiment_scores.json fixture** — every value is a literal; allowlist-clean (no PII patterns; `Scripts/verify_no_pii_leak.mjs` confirms 48-file strict scope clean).

### Findings

- **High.** None.
- **Medium.** None.
- **Low / informational.** Two notes (both pre-existing, unchanged by Task 2.8): (i) `localhost:3000` hard-coded in `SentimentModule.tsx:8` (`const API`) — only consumed in the backend-mode POST branch; static mode never reaches it; pre-existing, cleanup deferred to a future module-config sweep. (ii) Authorization header bearer-token is read from `localStorage` and used in the backend POST — pre-existing pattern across modules; out of scope for Task 2.8.

**Result: clean (High = 0, Medium = 0).**

## §6 — Rollback

Atomic per-commit rollback supported (3 commits total in branch — fixture+handlers / module-rewire+types+isStaticMode / tests):

```
# Full revert (restore pre-Task-2.8 state — back to main@d964a72)
git revert 19eb965 0e103ec 962c452

# Selective: revert only the tests (keep handlers + rewire; sentiment.test.ts
# reverts to placeholder stub; vitest 166 → 159).
git revert 19eb965

# Selective: revert only the module rewire + types hoist + isStaticMode export
# (keep handlers + fixture as orphan data; SentimentModule reverts to raw
# fetches; isStaticMode export removed; packages/types Sentiment* types
# removed; tests fail because they import the types).
git revert 0e103ec

# Selective: revert only the fixture + handlers (handlers gone; module
# imports break because SentimentScoreView types still resolve but
# /sentiment/* routes 404; tests fail with handler-not-found assertions).
git revert 962c452
```

**Per-commit gate verification:** each commit was independently green on `tsc -b` + `vitest run` (+ commit D adds the dual `vite build` mode + PII scan re-run since it's the final commit before E). Selective reverts of C or B alone leave the codebase in a partial state (commit D depends on C which depends on B); for a clean rollback, prefer the full 3-commit revert.

---

## §7 — Deferred / out-of-scope

1. **v1 L144 "3,274 captured tenants" → Phase-3 AppFolio re-capture ledger entry.** v1's tenant total (3,274) was a pre-capture-actual estimation that didn't match the absorbed surface (322 active tenants from Phase-1 entity import). Same class as Task 2.4's "50-property seed" → 36 real properties drift. Phase-3 AppFolio re-capture should backfill the missing ~2,950 tenant records along with the corresponding sentiment surface (more diverse property / community / unit-tag distribution).

2. **Fixture-realism: uniquePropertyIds.size = 2 → ideally ≥5 in Phase-3.** The 40-row fixture clusters across only 2 unique propertyIds (`705a6f52` Riverwood Club Apartments — 26 rows / 14 at-risk; `52d4e301` — 14 rows / 6 at-risk). Artifact of "first 40 tenants by sorted tenantId" — tenants cluster by property in entities.json. Phase-3 AppFolio re-capture should diversify the at-risk seed across more flagship properties (target ≥5 per the Task 2.10 multi-source merge precedent). Test #7 pins the value at 2 explicitly so a future expansion bumps the constant deliberately rather than drifting silently.

3. **Riverwood + Woodland Parc anchor convergence (cross-task).** Phase-2 has consolidated heavily around two flagship properties — **Riverwood Club Apartments** (Task 2.1 9 AHA inspections, Task 2.6 Georgia Power utility seed, Task 2.8 26 of 40 sentiment rows) and **Woodland Parc Townhomes** (Task 2.9 Projects target per v1 L146). This was not a coordinated decision; it's an emergent property of "first-N-by-sorted-id" picks landing on Riverwood-clustered tenants and a small set of pinned named properties. Phase-3 AppFolio re-capture should consciously distribute new seed work to a broader anchor set (e.g., 128 Buena Vista, 2070 Azalea, plus the page-2-through-5 properties not yet absorbed) to reduce single-property over-weighting in cross-task fixtures.

4. **`isStaticMode` precedent — future module migrations.** Task 2.8 is the first module-level consumption of `isStaticMode` from `strataApi.ts`. Other modules with raw POSTs in static-mode-broken paths (`TenantPortalModule.tsx:156`, `CorporateReview.tsx:90/105/119/132/145`) are candidates for the same retrofit pattern. Out of scope for Task 2.8; can be picked up as a small grouped PR in Phase 3 cleanup or opportunistically when those modules are next touched.

5. **POST `/sentiment/response` static-handler stub deferred.** v2.8 §8 L330 listed only 3 GET handlers (`/sentiment/scores`, `/sentiment/history`, `/sentiment/by-entity`). A POST `/sentiment/response` static-mode stub (append-to-localStorage simulator) was not in scope. Static-mode users see the "🗒️ Survey submission requires backend mode (static deck is read-only)" message instead. If a Phase-3 task wants in-deck survey recording, the obvious extension is a `strataPost('/sentiment/response')` handler that appends a `SentimentResponse` to the matching tenant's `responses[]` via the static-impl's `_created` change journal.

## §8 — Next-task unblock

**Phase-2 remaining: Task 2.9 Projects.** Per plan v2.8 §8 + scheduling-pass §6 item #10 — Projects entity-grouped Kanban seed (reuse WO 19441-1 sheetrock replacement on Woodland Parc 2767-3 as the canonical fixture). Branch off `main` post-Task-2.8 squash-merge.

**No B3-class blockers.** `packages/types/index.ts` is now general-pool; Task 2.8's post-B3 additive append closed cleanly with Appendix D row 1 text UNCHANGED (precedent across PRs #8–#16). Task 2.9 may touch it freely or skip it (Workitem interface from Task 1.4 is already sufficient if Task 2.9 lands as a workitem-pattern seed; ProjectsModule rewire is the open question — DoR-PRE1 should re-verify whether `ProjectsModule.tsx` already routes through `strataApi.ts` or hits `localhost:3000` directly).

**Sentinel-file ownership snapshot post-Task-2.8 merge:**
- `packages/types/index.ts` — general-pool (Task 2.9 may touch additively, or skip if Workitem reuse is sufficient).
- `strataApi.static.ts` — general-pool (`Task 2.* rebase onto each other`); Task 2.9 rebases onto `<Task 2.8 squash SHA>` if a `/projects` handler is added.
- `entities.json` — Phase-4 owner; Task 2.9 must NOT touch.
- `workitems.json` — Phase-2 sequential `Task 2.1 → 2.6 → 2.9` if Task 2.9 lands as workitem seed.
- `properties.json` — Task 2.4 + 2.10 retired READ-ONLY; Task 2.9 must NOT touch.
- `sentiment_scores.json` — Task 2.8 only (this PR establishes the row).

Task 2.9 is the single remaining Phase-2 task; Phase-2 closure is one merge away.
